## (1) Basecalling

High accurarcy basecalling with Guppy. Execute [ClusterBasecalling.sh](shell/ClusterBasecalling.sh) on the Cluster. You need to modify the parameters in the first rows of the script

## (2) NanoPlot

Run NanoPlot analysis of the BaseCalled reads, or subsets of it. The information to be passed to the script [Nanoplot.sh](shell/Nanoplot.sh) needs to be provided in a `sequencing_summary.txt` as generated by the Guppy pipeline. A typical commandline looks like this:

```bash
sh shell/Nanoplot.sh \
path/to/sequencing_summary.txt \
path/to/outputfolder \
SomeName
```

## (2) Lambda reads

This pipeline isolates reads with BLAST hits against the lambda phage reference J02459.1 with an e-value &lt; 1e-100 and produces a NanoPlot summary for this subset (see above).

```bash
sh shell/Lambda.sh \
path/to/InputfolderWithAllFastqFiles \
path/to/outputfolder \
path/to/sequencing_summary.txt
```
